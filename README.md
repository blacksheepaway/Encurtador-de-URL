# URL Shortener

Welcome to the URL Shortener project! This application allows users to shorten long URLs quickly and easily with a user-friendly graphical interface. The application uses the `pyshorteners` library to generate short URLs, and `tkinter` to create a clean and intuitive GUI.

## How it Works

The URL Shortener application lets users input a long URL, which is then shortened using the `pyshorteners` library. The application generates a short URL using the TinyURL service and displays it in the GUI. Users can also copy the short URL to their clipboard with a single click.

## Technologies and Techniques

- Python
- URL shortening with `pyshorteners`
- `tkinter` for creating the graphical user interface

## Example

When the URL Shortener application is run, users can input the long URL they want to shorten. After clicking the "URL Encurtado" button, the application generates and displays the short URL in the interface.

## Modification for Other Applications

The URL Shortener application can be easily modified for various purposes. For example, you could:

- Add support for additional URL shortening services
- Create a history of shortened URLs, allowing users to revisit previously shortened links
- Integrate with a user authentication system to track and manage shortened URLs for individual users
